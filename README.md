# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of handwashing on the reduction of mortality rates in hospitals, inspired by the historical work of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis. The analysis is conducted using Python programming language and data visualization libraries.

## Project Overview

Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician in the mid-19th century who observed the significant difference in mortality rates between two maternity wards at Vienna General Hospital. One ward was staffed by doctors, while the other was staffed by midwives. The project aims to explore and visualize the impact of handwashing on the mortality rates of new mothers.

## Data

The data used in this analysis is provided in the `datasets` folder. It contains information about the monthly number of births and the number of deaths due to childbirth fever for each year from 1841 to 1849 in the two maternity wards.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a Python environment using the pandas library.
2. Data Cleaning: Any missing or inconsistent values are handled, and the data is prepared for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is explored through descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the patterns and trends.
4. Data Visualization: Matplotlib or Seaborn libraries are used to create visualizations to effectively communicate the findings.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `workspace` folder: Contains the dataset and the Jupyter Notebook file.
  - `datasets` folder: Contains the dataset files:
    - `1_ignaz_semmelweis_1860.jpeg`
    - `2_monthly_deaths.csv`
    - `3_project_image.png`: 
    - 4_yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv
  - `notebook.ipynb`: 
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
